This definition may vary based on the sponsor's requirements for characterizing and reporting product safety and is usually described in the protocol. For example, the sponsor may submit one record that covers an adverse event from start to finish. Alternatively, if there is a need to evaluate AEs at a more granular level, a sponsor may submit a new record when severity, causality, or seriousness changes or worsens. By submitting these individual records, the sponsor indicates that each is considered to represent a different event. The submission dataset structure may differ from the structure at the time of collection. For example, a sponsor might collect data at each visit in order to meet operational needs, but submit records that summarize the event and contain the highest level of severity, causality, seriousness, etc. Examples of dataset structure:
1. One record per adverse event per subject for each unique event. Multiple adverse event records reported by the investigator are submitted as summary records \"collapsed\" to the highest level of severity, causality, seriousness, and the final outcome.
2. One record per adverse event per subject. Changes over time in severity, causality, or seriousness are submitted as separate events. Alternatively, these changes may be submitted in a separate dataset based on the Findings About Events and Interventions model (see Section 6.4).
3. Other approaches may also be reasonable as long as they meet the sponsor's safety evaluation requirements and each submitted record represents a unique event. The domain-level metadata (See Section 3.2) should clarify the structure of the dataset."""^^xsd:string ;

  cdiscs:assumptionText "QS Definition: A written or electronic survey instrument comprised of a series of questions, designed to measure a specific item or set of items. Questionnaires are research instruments that usually have a documented method of administration, a standard format for data collection, and documented methods for scoring, analysis, and interpretation of results. A questionnaire is often analyzed by applying a numeric scoring system to question responses, where each question response is assigned a specific numeric .score. that can be totaled to give an overall score (and possibly sectional sub-scores). Questionnaire data may include, but are not limited to subject reported outcomes and validated or non-validated questionnaires. The QS domain is not intended for use in submitting a set of questions grouped on the CRF for convenience of data capture. Some diaries are vehicles for collecting data for a validated questionnaire while others may simply facilitate capture of routine study data. When objective numeric data with result Qualifiers are collected in a questionnaire or diary format, the sponsor should consider whether this data actually belongs in a separate (new or existing) domain. For example, if the subject records the number of caffeinated beverages consumed each day in a diary, this information might be more appropriate for the Substance Use domain. The names of the questionnaires should be described under the variable QSCAT in the questionnaire domain. These could be either abbreviations or longer names, at the sponsor's discretion until controlled terminology is developed. For example, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS), SF-36 Health Survey (SF36), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)."^^xsd:string ;

This definition is not totally independent of the Trial Arms dataset, since it relies on knowing where in the trial design the Element is used, and that it always follows a treatment Element. Defining a clear starting point for the start of a non-treatment Element that always follows another non-treatment Element can be particularly difficult. The transition may be defined by a decision-making activity such as enrollment or randomization.

The following example shows the preferred approach for representing this information. However, the approach depends on how the data for split and merged tumors are captured. To follow the preferred approach, measurements of each distinct tumor must be captured individually. In the example target tumor T04, identified at the SCREEN visit, splits into two at WEEK 16. Two new records are created with TUTEST=\"Tumor Split\" and the TULNKID reflects the split by adding 0.1 & 0.2 to the original TULNKID value. At WEEK 24, in the example below, target tumors T02 & T03, identified at screening, merge together. A single new record is created this TUTEST=\"Tumor Merged\" and the TULNKID reflects the original TULNKID values assigned at the SCREEN visit.

If the data collection does not support this approach (i.e., measurements of split tumors are reported as a summary under the 'parent' tumor), then it may not be possible to include a record in the TU domain.
